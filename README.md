# design-checklist
Down the line, I've often come to realize during (or after) design hand-off: "hmm.. is this well-thought" or "this design does not seem to take this into account". Therefore I've created a checklist to go through, before and during design phase, to make sure most design decisions has been properly addressed sooner rather than later.

## How should this be interpreted?
This is NOT a set in stone "my way or the high way" document. This is a checklist to verify that design principles are well-thought AND an overview of approaches that deviate from these, to make sure that we have proper argumentation for doing so.

## The Checklist

### Content
- [ ] Design is not only useful with "perfect" data.
- [ ] Design does not dictate content.

### Input fields
- [ ] Text inputs has labels (not only placeholders).
- [ ] Take advantage of native scrollwheels on mobile (e.g. datetime-local).

### Selects / Dropdowns
- [ ] Select inputs doesn't disable native behavior (e.g. scrollwheel on mobile).
